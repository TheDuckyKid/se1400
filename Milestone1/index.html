        The website will contain a reference guide for video game collectors, including high-quality images of video game consoles, troubleshooting guides for common console issues, and pricing guides for games and hardware. It will also feature searchable data, side-by-side console comparisons, and historical pricing trends.
      </p>
      
      <h4>Where will you get all of the content for your site (i.e., images & text)?</h4>

      <h4>What is the goal of the site?</h4>
      <p>
        The website aims to be a comprehensive reference for video game collectors, helping them make informed decisions about their collections, maintain their hardware, and track market trends. It will serve as a valuable tool for both new and experienced collectors.
