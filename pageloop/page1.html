        Pong is a 1972 sports video game developed and published by Atari for
        arcades. It is one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by
        Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder
        Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were
        surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the
        game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic ping-pong game
        included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In
        response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

        Space Invaders is a 1978 shoot 'em up video game developed and published
        by Taito for arcades . It was released in Japan in April 1978, with the
        game being released by Midway Manufacturing overseas. Space Invaders was
        the first fixed shooter and the first video game with endless gameplay
        (meaning there was no final level or endscreen) and set the template for
        the genre. The goal is to defeat wave after wave of descending aliens
        with a horizontally moving laser cannon to earn as many points as
        possible.
